Using Nielsen ratings for locally televised {NFL} football games, this study investigates the determinants of {NFL} viewership.  Data are compiled for 496 {NFL} games during the 2000 and 2001 seasons.  The results suggest evidence of race, team success, and the closeness of the contest as significant determinants of {NFL} viewership.},
